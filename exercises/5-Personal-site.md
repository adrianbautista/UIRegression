# Personal/Work Site

## Goal
Set up a regression test suite for a personal/work website.

## Assignment
1. Set up either Wraith or PhantomCSS (or both) on a website that you've recently worked on (personal or work related). 
2. If you run across difficulties getting something set up, reach out to the community via Twitter or by opening a GitHub issue.
