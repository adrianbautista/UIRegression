## Having Installation Troubles?

Sometimes we customize our machines a little too much, or end up with an out of date dependency that just won't upgrade, causing installation frustration and dependency nightmares. If you're faced with a situation like this, here are a couple alternative ways to get things set up:

- Use [Cloud9IDE](http://c9.io), clone this repo and install the tools via its command line.
- Work off of a virtual machine using a tool like [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
