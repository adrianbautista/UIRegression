UI Regression Workshop
============

The five exercises outlined in this repo are aimed at providing an introduction to UI regression testing. They're designed to provide a partially real-world codebase from which to demo three tools: Wraith, PhantomCSS and DiffUX.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo to your local dev environment
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Get started with [the first exercise](./exercises/1-Wraith.md)

## Having Installation Troubles?

Sometimes we customize our machines a little too much, or end up with an out of date dependency that just won't upgrade, causing installation frustration and dependency nightmares. If you're faced with a situation like this, here are a couple alternative ways to get things set up:

- Use [Cloud9IDE](http://c9.io), clone this repo and install the tools via its command line.
- Work off of a virtual machine using a tool like [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

## Technical Skills Required

- Basic understanding of the command line
- Intermediate understanding of CSS/SASS
- Intermediate understanding of JavaScript
